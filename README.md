Overview of the project:
A Bus Reservation System is a software application designed
to automate and streamline the process of booking bus tickets.
It enables passengers to search available buses, check seat
availability, choose preferred seats, and make reservations
efficiently. The system also provides administrative
functionalities for managing buses, schedules, routes, fares,
and customer records.
By replacing manual, paper-based processes, the system
enhances accuracy, reduces human errors, and improves
overall service quality. Modern bus reservation systems often
include features like real-time seat updates, digital payments,
automated notifications, and secure login functionalities for
both administrators and users.
For bus operators, the system simplifies operational activities
such as route planning, managing bookings, tracking
occupancy, and generating reports. For customers, it offers
convenience, speed, and transparency by allowing reservations
from anywhere, at any time.
Overall, a Bus Reservation System improves operational
efficiency, supports scalability, and enhances the travel
experience for both bus operators and passengers.
