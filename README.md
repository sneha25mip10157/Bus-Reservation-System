# Bus-Reservation-System
A Bus Reservaion System is a software application designed to make the process of booking bus tickets easier, faster , and more organised for both passengers and administrators. The problem it aims to solve the inconvenience and inefficiency of manual ticket booking, such as long queues, difficulty in checking seat availability, human errors, and challenges in managing records. By digitising the reservation process,the system ensures accurate seat tracking, instant booking, cancellation, payment handling, and efficient management of buses and schedules.
The development of system begins with requirement analysis where the needs of users (passengers, booking staff and administrators) are identified. Functional requirements include adding buses, viewing routes, checking seat availability, booking seats, generating tickets and managing reservations. Non-functional requirements include data accuracy, ease of use ,security, error handling, and fast performance. Once requirement are clearly understood,the next step is top-down design or modularization, where the entire system is broken into smaller modules such as bus management module, reservation module, seat availability module, payment module and report generation module. This decomposition makes the system easier to develop Debug and maintain.
Following this, algorithm development involves defining step-by-step logical procedures for each operation. For example, in seat booking, the algorithm includes selecting a bus, checking available seats, verifying input, updating the booking list and generating confirmation. Each module has clear algorithm that ensure correct and efficient operations. When these algorithms are ready, the system enters the implementation phase, where these algorithms are converted into working code using a programming language such as Python, Java, or C++. The data stored in files or database, and the system interface is developed for user interaction.
After implementation, the system undergoes testing and refinement. Different testing methods such as unit testing, integration testing and user testing are performed to ensure all modules work correctly and together. Errors found during testing are fixed and improvements are made to enhance our ability and performance requirement also includes optimisation code improving the UI and ensuring the system handles invalid input safely. Through this process,the Bus Reservation System becomes a reliable, user-friendly and efficient applications suitable for real-world use.
